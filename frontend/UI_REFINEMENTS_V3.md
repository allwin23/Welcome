# UI Refinements V3

I have implemented the latest layout adjustments based on your feedback.

## Changes
1.  **Reduced Width**: The main container max-width has been reduced from `1600px` to `1440px` (approx 10% reduction).
2.  **Top Alignment**: The layout container is now aligned to the top (`items-start`), ensuring the Navbar stays at the very top of the page.
3.  **Increased Spacing**: The vertical gap between the Navbar and the main content (Sidebar/Chat) has been increased to `gap-y-12` (3rem/48px), providing clear visual separation.

## Verification
-   `npm run build` passed successfully.

The layout should now be narrower and have ample space between the top navigation and the chat interface.
